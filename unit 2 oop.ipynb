    "Abstraction in Python is a concept that allows you to create abstract classes and abstract methods. Abstraction is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of a class Abstraction allows you to define common methods and properties in the abstract base class while forcing the subclasses to implement their own versions of those methods. This way, you can define a common interface for multiple related classes and provide a blueprint for their behavior."
