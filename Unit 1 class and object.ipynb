    "Name mangling is a mechanism in Python that modifies the names of class attributes to make them more \"private\" or \"protected\" by adding a prefix to the attribute name. This is done by prefixing the attribute name with two underscores (__) but without trailing underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic difference between data hiding and encapsulation is that data hiding focuses on data security, while encapsulation focuses on hiding the complexity of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is a method that helps wrapping up of data into a single module.by which reduce complexibility of code and ensure data is only accessible through specific methods.  Encapsulation brings together the data and the methods that manipulate the data into a single component and protects them from outside interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benifits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Protection: Encapsulation helps protect data by hiding the internal implementation details of a class. It allows you to define data members as private, which can only be accessed and modified through public methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Information Hiding: Encapsulation enables you to hide the complexity of the underlying implementation and expose only essential information through well-defined interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Flexibility and Modularity: Encapsulation promotes flexibility and modularity in software development. By encapsulating data and behavior within classes, you can modify the internal implementation of a class without affecting other parts of the program that rely on its interface\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Code Reusability: Encapsulation supports code reusability. Once you have defined a class with its data and methods, you can create multiple instances of that class and reuse them in different parts of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data hiding, also known as information hiding, is a principle within encapsulation that involves restricting the direct access to the internal data of a class from outside code.It is associated with data security.The data is always private and inaccessible."
